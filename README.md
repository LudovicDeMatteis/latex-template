# Latex Project
This project provides a structure to work with LaTeX documents.

I personnaly use
[TinyTex](https://yihui.org/tinytex/) (a light-weight distribution of [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/)),
so this project is organized assuming `latexmk` will be used to build the document.

Please see [the original template repo](https://github.com/LudovicDeMatteis/latex-template) to get more info on the repo structure, github actions and more.
